# DAQSimulator
This report contains information about a DAQ Simulation Application which is used for manually sampling and logging sensor values. In this application we didnâ€™t connect any sensor device and values were generated to simulate sensor devices. This type of application is useful for testing of Process Control System (PCS) prior to attach sensor devices as a testing procedure. This application will simulate collecting sensor values at sampling time and logging them on a csv file.
